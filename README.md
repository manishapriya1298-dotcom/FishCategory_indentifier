🐟 **Fish Species Classification Dataset**
📦 **Overview**
This dataset is designed for multiclass image classification of fish species. It supports training, validation, and testing workflows for deep learning models, particularly in computer vision tasks involving aquatic biodiversity, fisheries management, or ecological monitoring.

🚀 Project Goals
- Enhanced Accuracy: Identify the most effective model architecture for fish image classification using grayscale or RGB inputs.
- Deployment Ready: Build a responsive web interface for real-time predictions, optimized for usability and performance.
- Model Comparison: Evaluate multiple architectures and training strategies to select the best-performing model.

🧪 Data Splits
- Training set: ~70% of total images
- Validation set: ~15% for tuning hyperparameters
- Test set: ~15% for final evaluation
