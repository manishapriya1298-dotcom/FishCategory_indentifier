🐟 Fish Species Classification Dataset
📦 Overview
This dataset is designed for multiclass image classification of fish species. It supports training, validation, and testing workflows for deep learning models, particularly in computer vision tasks involving aquatic biodiversity, fisheries management, or ecological monitoring.

🧪 Data Splits
- Training set: ~70% of total images
- Validation set: ~15% for tuning hyperparameters
- Test set: ~15% for final evaluation
📊 Image Details
- Format: .jpg / .png
- Resolution: Varies (recommended preprocessing to standardize)
- Color: RGB or Grayscale (compatible with EfficientNet, ResNet, MobileNet)
🛠️ Recommended Pipeline
- Preprocessing: Resize, normalize, augment (flip, rotate, contrast)
- Modeling: Use pretrained CNNs (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, MobileNetV2)
- Training: Cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer, early stopping
- Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix
